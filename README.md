GAMEPLAY -

1. Beware the orange tiles. They are fragile and will break when you will stand on them. The only way you can get through the tiles is by laying down.
2. The dark brown tiles open bridges to the disconnected islands on the board.
3. The light brown tiles toggle bridges. They open them if there are no bridges and will close them if the bridge already exists.
4. You need to stand upon the green tile to win the level.
5. You can move in any way on the yellow tiles or the bridge tiles.
6. There are 2 levels and you need to clear both levels to win the game.
